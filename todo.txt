Big:
* Animation system
* World builder
* UI

Todo:
 [ ] fix physics to be a system
 [X] find how octree should be handled
 [ ] mtl and obj file parsing should output standard types
 [ ] animation file format
 [ ] change mesh structure
 [ ] save a `World`
 [ ] reflection for entities
 [X] get rid of `Scene`
 [ ] add Focus enum to resource manager and use it in controllers

Low:
 [ ] fonts should be grayscale, and then you can choose text color in command

graveyard:

// TODO: for each free id, rotate the entities so it'd make sense, and patch
// entity_ptrs accordingly (this is expensive)
void ecs_compress(World *world) {}
